1. [Example 1 (Basic Usage)](<../examples/Ex 1 (Basic Usage).ipynb>)
    
    Demonstrates the basic usage of PowerMethod and its comparison to a standard "exact" decomposition method.
2. [Example 2 (Persisting and Memory)](<../examples/Ex 2 (Persisting and Memory).ipynb>)
    
    Demonstrates the trade-offs and benefits of persisting (storing in RAM) vs lazy loading an array.
3. [Example 3 (SuccessiveBatchedPowerMethod Usage)](<../examples/Ex 3 (SuccessiveBatchedPowerMethod).ipynb>)
    
    Demonstrates the benefit of utilizing previous singular value decompositions instead of restarting each time.
4. [Example 4 (Clusters)](<../examples/Ex 4 (Clusters).ipynb>)
   
    Demonstrates how PowerMethod and SuccessiveBatchedPowerMethod can be used with Clusters.
